# Admin panel application

## Overview

The admin web application serves as the interface between the database and content that is served over the serverlet application.

The web application allows the **admins** _(users with elevated permissions to manage content)_ to **view, edit and delete** subjects, units, topics and the content for each of the earlier stated hierarchial unit.

Every route and operation is secured with **token-based authentication**.

## Architecture

### Functions

The admin panel is a **client-side** rendered web application which makes extensive use of built in JavaScript functions like `fetch`, `alert`, and `prompt` to handle data fetching and intimation of status to the user.

It makes heavy usage of React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to handle state management and page lifecycle.

The admin panel upload the specific resources to be created on the **`Firebase Storage`** instance hosted in the nearest non-quota center, i.e, `us-central-1`, to retrive a downloadable URL to be parsed into the POST APIs at the time of resource creation.

### Features

1. View existing courses
2. Add new courses mapped to GITAM courses
3. View units of a specific course

## Authentication

The admin is greeted to authenticate with the credentials of their learning management system portal, to provide secure authentication and to uniquely map the student admin to their account on CHITTI, in exchange for an authentication token provided by the Firebase Auth Admin SDK.

The token is then stored as a short-lived cookie which is appended as the **Bearer** `Authorization` headers of APIs sent through the admin panel.
